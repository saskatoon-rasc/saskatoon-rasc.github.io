 of the images that Peter acquires on the trips and during the testing of the astrographs he designs.  She is Past President
 of the RASC-Ottawa Centre.  Debra has been honoured with the RASC Ken Chilton Prize.  She is a discoverer of two supernovae
 with the Tim Puckett Supernova Search Team.<P><P>
	<B>Fr. Lucian Kemble Memorial Lecture: <I>Image Processing and Food-Getting Back to Nature</I></B> - For the past several years, image processing has been a passion for Debra. Her philosophy to producing an image resembles her philosophy to living, getting as close to nature as possible. Debra pokes fun at the false colour Hubble palette and compares her natural approach of image processing, to her approach to food in a playful way. Debra will also share her new Photoshop technique of processing images with RGB and narrowband layers colour-mapped as closely as possible to the wavelengths of the visible spectrum, to achieve the ultimate true colour image.<P>

He has also been active in the astronomical community, both Canadian and internationally for the past 35 years. Peter was part of a team of individuals and companies awarded the Alouette prize for his work on MOST, Canada&#39s first space telescope. Peter was also part of the team that was awarded the RASC&#39s Ken Chilton Prize for the Comet Hyakutake time lapse movie project. Peter along with his wife Debra travel extensively to do astro imaging as well as flying their small aircraft all over North America.<P><P>
	<B>Presentation: <I>Comet Hyakutake: A look back at the making of an astronomical motion picture</I></B> - Fifteen years ago Peter Ceravolo photographed comet Hyakutake with a custom astrograph all night, every night, for two weeks compiling hundreds of images of the comet&#39s tail gyrating in the solar wind. Paul Boltwood CCD-imaged the comet with his own home-built camera taking hundreds of high res images of the inner coma. Working with Peter&#39s and Paul&#39s data, Doug George processed the images to create the best ever time lapse movies of a comet&#39s tail and its lawn sprinkler gas jets. Peter will reminisce about what it was like to do this extreme astronomy and how much easier it would be to do today<P>

He has held positions on Centre Councils, National Council and is currently the National Observing Chair. Chris has enjoyed binocular observing for almost 2 decades and during 2002/3 observed all the Messier objects using 10X50 binoculars. This past winter he used 7X50&#39s with filters tapped over one barrel to observe faint wisps of The Orion Molecular Cloud. Chris enjoys pushing the limits of what the eye can show under a truly dark sky, he is a supporter of Dark Sky Preserves and frequently visits Cypress Hills and Grasslands National Park DSP&#39s.<P><P>

	<B>Welcome to the SSSP Guided Binocular Sky Tour!</B> -  You will use your own binoculars for star-hopping the Milky&#45Way while you are guided to spectacular deep space objects such as Messiers&#39 Nebula & Star Clusters. We will also take a stroll &#34off the beaten path&#34 viewing some of the great binocular objects such as Kemble’s Cascade and some Dark Nebulae. All of this under the ideal & pristine conditions of the Cypress Hills Dark Sky Preserve. The tour will be aimed at both beginners and experienced observers alike, there will be something for everyone.<P>

                 Although the official name has not yet been chosen, the Cypress Hills Observatory will have a ribbon cutting ceremony on Thursday, August 25, at 3:00 pm.  We expect Wayne Elhard, MLA for Cypress Hills, will be in attendance, and we hope the event will generate media interest in the observatory and the Dark-Sky Preserve.  The ceremony and observatory project are organized by the  <a href=”http://www.friendsofthepark.ca/”>Friends of Cypress Hills Park</a> (FOCHP).  Construction on the observatory and adjoining Yurt classroom will continue over the summer of 2011.<P>

The BBQ is currently planned to be held after the Cypress Observatory Ribbon Cutting at the Dark-Sky Campground, immediately NW of the Meadows.  The BBQ should begin about 4:30 or 5:00 pm.  Money from the BBQ will go toward the construction and maintenance of the observatory, so feel free to &#96overpay&#96 for the BBQ or make a further donation at the BBQ.

                 The SSSP sketching workshop will be held in the observing field and will consist of a brief discussion of tools, tips, and techniques used to sketch deep sky objects.  Jack will show examples under red light to demonstrate the steps and techniques he uses to complete a sketch.  Participants will then have an opportunity to try some sketching using a few telescopes that will be available at the workshop.<P>
                 Please note that artistic ability is NOT a requirement for attending the workshop.  Astronomical sketching is mostly a means to capture what you see at the eyepiece and you will likely become a better observer even if no one ever sees the drawings but you.  The extra attention needed to complete a drawing often allows one to see subtle details like foreground stars on galaxies, interesting concentrations or patterns of faint stars in open clusters etc. that may not be apparent with just a quick look at an object.<P>
                 Providing a detailed description of a target is also an important part of documenting what you observe and guidelines for describing different types of objects (open clusters, globular clusters, galaxies, etc.) will also be discussed.<P>

                Sketching templates and a few sets of pencils and tools for use at the workshop will be provided.  All you need to bring is a red light and a willingness to give sketching a try!<P>

                Kathleen Houston of the Saskatoon Centre has written an article on sketching at the eyepiece that has been published in the <I>Journal</I>.  You can find it <a href="Houston.pdf">here</a>.<P>

	<B>Update:</B>The workshop is now full and is not accepting any new participants.  Due to the larger than anticipated demand, Jack Milliken will be assisted by Kathleen Houston.  Participants will be organized into two groups working concurrently.<P>

               The Resort catering staff will be serving the "Classic" single meat entree buffet.  The banquet is served in the Wapiti Room.  It starts at 6:00 pm Saturday.  <P>

The menu includes: Italian Roasted Chicken; Roasted Potatoes; Pasta, Tossed, and Onion and Tomato Salads; Assorted Desserts; Coffee and Tea.<P>

Costs for the banquet are: Adults, $32; Youth 7-12 yr, $18; Children under 7 yr, free.  Prices for the banquet have been adjusted from the 2010 prices due to increases passed to the SSSP by the Resort.  Adult prices rise by $2 from $30 to $32, and youth prices rise by $4 from $14 to $18.  On the upside, more kids will eat for free.  The free banquet is now in place for kids ages 0 to 6 and paid-for banquets for kids now 7 &#45 12. Note that SSSP costs the banquet at a break-even pricing level.<P>

There are only <B>130</B> places for the banquet.  They will be allocated on a "first registered, first allocated" basis.  <B>We strongly suggest that you preorder your tickets when you send in your registration.</B>  A limited number of places will be held for at-the-door registrations but only if the 130 place limit has not yet been exceeded.<P>

We also ask you, if you find that you are not able to come to the banquet but have preordered tickets, to contact us immediately.  We will refund your banquet ticket costs and will allocate your tickets to people on our waiting list.  <B>If you do not contact us beforehand and you do not show up, your banquet ticket costs will NOT be refunded.</B>  See <A HREF="#refund">Refund Policy</A> for more information.<P>    

<B>Update:</B>  The number of banquet places has been reduced from 160 to 130 due to reduced demand.  However, there are still places available.<P>

	<B>MAIN OBSERVING at SSSP will be within the Ball Diamond area,</B> one road before the old Meadows entrance.  It is substantially the same size as the Meadows viewing area and still has a good south view.  It also has a treed barrier to the road.  It is nearer to the Sasktel tower but the tower lights are red (and currently only one of three lights is working!)  There is NO power in the Aspen, Sunseet or Dark&#45Sky campsites, nor on the Ball Diamond.  You must be self&#45sufficient for your power needs.  The Campground Office will assign you a campsite in the Aspen, Sunset or Meadows campgrounds that surround the Ball Diamond.  Alternately, you may ask them to camp you &#34in the open&#34 in or around the Ball Diamond, if you prefer, away from a designated campsite, or in the Dark&#45sky campground, which is fairly far away from the main observing field.  Note that the Ball Diamond is a big open field with no shade trees and no picnic tables.  Aspen and Sunset are treed campsites with picnic tables a minute&#39s walk away if you want to be cooler!<P>

	We will allow camping in open areas if you want to be right next to your telescope, but <B>only tents and smaller vehicles (cars), please, should occupy the grass within the central open area of the observing field.</B>  Please keep RVs and wheeled campers more to the (very large) periphery of the Ball Diamond so that line&#45of&#45site for observers can be maintained and damage to the grass field does not occur in case of wet weather.  You may set your telescope up in the Ball Diamond for the weekend regardless of where you are camping.   If you are not intending to stay the entire night at your telescope and have set up for the weekend, and are able&#45bodied, we suggest, as a courtesy, that you drive in, set up, then move your car to park at the entrance as not to disturb others as you exit.  We are somewhat concerned for the safety of people and equipment, since the Ball Diamond does not have predetermined roads to guide night movement of vehicles, so please keep vehicle movement to a minimum. If unsure about where to set up, please see the Registration Tent, Road Security people or an SSSP organizer.  Thank you for your cooperation.  As in other years, unoccupied &#34equipment tents&#34 are allowed at no cost, but you should pin a note to the tent stating it is an unoccupied equipment tent to avoid an argument in case Park staff check tenting permits...and it must be unoccupied!<P>

	<B>All SSSP participants are responsible for booking and paying for their own camp sites no matter where they camp.</B>  To do this, register with the Park Campground Office upon arrival at SSSP and get your camping permit and site number.  All unpowered sites are RUSH this year, and cannot be pre&#45booked.  If you have pre&#45booked one of the 24 &#45 30 powered sites, you will still have to show up at the campround office upon arrival to get your site number assignment.  <B>Remember to say you are &#34with the star party&#34.</B><P>

	<B>Campgrounds:</B> Sunset (~40 sites), Aspen (~40 sites), Meadows (only 30 powered sites by the road) and Dark Sky campgrounds (42 sites) are all reserved for SSSP campers from Aug. 23 through Aug. 29.  <B>Only the Reserve&#45a&#45Site sites</B> (30 powered sites in Meadows) <B>can be booked in advance on&#45line through the Provincial Parks website. These are the only powered sites,</B> so we would encourage everyone who absolutely doesn&#39t need a powered site not to take one.  <B>In order to get a pre&#45booked site, one MUST identify themselves as <B>&#34with the star party&#34</B> when booking.</B>  They can only be pre&#45booked for the star party on the star party dates.  If you get a pre&#45booking, you will get a site, but you will not be assigned a site number until you arrive.  If you book days outside of the star party dates, you may have to move sites.  This is just how it is, don&#39t complain, and please do not argue with the Campground people over this!<P>

	At the time of this announcement (June 30), 10 of the 30 powered campsites have been reserved.  <B>We recommend that anyone who is in these sites that does not want lots of white lights (cars) driving by (especially during the public star party hours), set up in the ball diamond with the rest of the group.</B>  There are no tree barriers to lights in the Meadows camping sites, and there will be many cars coming and going from the public star nights now held at the Dark&#45Sky Campground between 9:00 and 11:00 pm on Friday and Saturday.  White light will not be a problem on the Ball Diamond.<P>

	<B>All other campsites (for tents and trailers) in Sunset, Aspen and Dark&#45Sky campgrounds are RUSH</B> and cannot be pre&#45booked on the web&#45site.  <B>They can be booked upon arrival at the star party,</B> and only star party people will be put into these sites.    <B>There is ample room for everyone who will camp at the star party.</B>  Because some campsites are closer to the observing field, we will recommend that the campground office fill Sunset and Aspen first, and Dark&#45Sky last, since Dark&#45Sky is about 1/2 km from the observing field.  No sites have power, but all campsites have picnic tables and fire&#45pits except for 14 new Dark&#45Sky overflow sites (#29 &#45 #42) that have only picnic tables.<P> 

	<B>We recommend that if people want to come before or stay after the star party, that they book into the Dark Sky Campground, because it is DARK, and then move into the other campground for the star party dates.</B>  We cannot guarantee that Meadows lights will be off anymore outside of star party days, especially in years going forward.<P>

	Meadows Campground (except for 30 sites) will be closed for the duration of 2011 for renovations to install new pull&#45through camper sites.  This means that the 108 powered sites will be completed and a service centre with flush toilets and showers will be built before the Meadows reopens in 2012.   Please be patient for this year, since next year we&#39ll be living in luxury!<P>

              SSSP pins commemorate the ribbon cutting for the Cypress Hills Observatory at the Dark-Sky campground and the first complete orbit of Neptune since its discovery (Neptune&#39s &#34First Sol&#34).  You may see the pins around before SSSP this year, since we have an agreement with the Friends of Cypress Hills Park to sell them at the park gift shop over the summer as a fund-raiser for the observatory project.  The pin was designed by Kathleen Houston.  Pin prices are as follows:<P>

If                      you do not intend to remain in the Observing Field all night long, park and set up near to the entrance  so you can leave without blinding everybody!</B>  Cars are to use their park-lights only, or be lead                     with their lights off by someone with a red flashlight.  (This is not advised for safety reasons and to                       be used only in an emergency). Gate security people will have a limited supply of red flags to cover car                      lights.  Cover the following lights: interior, back-up, license plate, trunk and headlights.

Lasers will be used extensively during the scheduled starwalks from 10:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m Friday and                        Saturday night.<P>

              The SSSP Committee welcomes astronomy (and related) dealers to set up booths at the SSSP.  At this event you have the potential to reach nearly 300 astronomy enthusiasts just looking to buy something.<P>  

To participate, you are asked to follow the standard registration procedure - i.e. vendors must register as normal participants at the normal costs for the star party.  You may in turn sell and conduct normal business within the Observing Field (but due to Park restrictions cannot solicit elsewhere in the park.)  The SSSP is not responsible for any of the vendor&#39s business costs (transportation, accommodation, living, etc.) Vendors are responsible for their own arrangements, park entry and must pay standard camping fees (to the Park) and camp site power if needed, if staying in the Meadows.  The SSSP is not responsible for any merchandise loss or damage.  As registered SSSP star party goers, all vendors are welcome to participate in all activities they have registered for.<P>

If you would like to donate a door prize, this will be graciously accepted & will be accordingly acknowledged, though a door prize donation is not required and is at the discretion of the vendor.  Vendors will receive a free 1/4-page ad in the star party handout literature or for $25 can purchase a full-page ad.  (Ads in the SSSP handout are gray-scale photocopied and are not in colour).  Alternately, the SSSP will pre-package vendor-supplied product brochures in our registration folders for 25 cents per copy.  Approximately 120 registration packages are handed out.  Vendor must provide the ad or the product brochures at least 2 weeks prior to the star party.  (Mail to or contact the Registrars).<P>

In a further attempt to foster this on-going good will, all star party vendors will be entitled to two separate half-page ads (or equivalent - e.g. four 1/4-page ads) in our monthly newsletter, over the coming year.  These ads are at no additional cost.  Our current newsletter circulation is approximately 80 copies, but these are highly targeted readers & the newsletters are also on-line.  All ads are subject to approval by the Saskatoon Centre Executive before inclusion in the newsletter.  We will do our best to publish the ad in the month desired, but this is also subject to available space within the newsletter.<P>

If shirts are pre-ordered, the SSSP may not be able to cancel shirt orders within 3 weeks of the star party.  If possible, refunds for shirts will be made, but if cancellation is not possible, shirts will be mailed out at the withdrawing participant&#39s cost after the star party.  No shows are defined as those who have not registered by the end of registration period on the Saturday afternoon of the star party.<P>

<B>However, banquet tickets are always in demand right up to the starting minute of the banquet!</B>  There is almost always a waiting list since banquet seating space is limited.  If you have not made previous arrangements and find that at the last minute you cannot come to the star party or cannot attend the banquet, <B>please telephone us at 306-280-9836</B> (star party cell) <B>and let us know if you will release your banquet tickets for resale.</B>  If we can resell your banquet tickets, we will refund the entire cost to you, even within the 48-hour no-refund window.  Someone at the star party will be delighted that you thought of them!  Otherwise, your tickets will be held for you assuming you will show up at the last minute and are thus not otherwise refundable.<P>

              In celebration of the <B>Cypress Hills Dark-Sky Preserve,</B> the SSSP hosts three public events during the star party, as public outreach is a mandate of the RASC and of the DSP agreement.  The events are co-sponsored and co-staffed by the Regina Centre, Saskatoon Centre and the Cypress Hills Inter-provincial Park.  These events are advertized in the park and in all communities within a 150 kilometer radius of the Park.  <B><I>The Living Skies Public Lecture</I></B> is held on Thursday evening at the Amphitheatre, and is open to SSSP attendees and the general public.  Typical attendance ranges from 200 to 350.  <B><I>Solar Observing</I></B> is held at the park entrance area near the Swimming Pool on Friday at 11 am, over the lunch hour.  Public Star Nights begin at dusk on Friday and Saturday nights at the <B>Dark-Sky Campground</B> near the <B>Cypress Observatory,</B> and is hosted by the Regina Centre.  The star parties draw 150 to 250 nightly.   SSSP attendees are highly encouraged to attend these events or to volunteer to help out, as they are fun and educational.<P>

            If you have not been to the Cypress Hills Inter-provincial Park, 
            you are missing something! This is a beautiful park, nested in 
            Lodgepole pines on a butte that reaches 1460 meters above sea level, 
            and is the highest point in Canada between the Rockies and Labrador. 
            (Because of the altitude - bring warm clothes for night time!) Its 
            unique position gives it an unusual weather advantage. Historical 
            weather maps published by Jay Anderson in the RASC Observer&#39s 
            Handbook indicate that the area around Cypress Hills has the best 
            chance for clear skies (less than 30 percent mean nighttime cloud 
            cover) in July and August compared to any other site in Canada.  Also,
            no mosquitos!<P>
            The park is very modern and well equipped for families of tired 
            astronomers. The park features a lake, hiking trails, paddle boats, 
            mini golf, regular golf, a general store, a full resort, two 
            restaurants, an ice-cream and snack shop, a souvenir shop, moose and 
            other varmints, ball diamonds, picnic 
            grounds, tennis courts, an outdoor heated pool, hot tub, a museum 
            and of course, the SSSP!<P>

            A new facility in the Park this year includes a tree-top zipline and climbing wall.  
            The zipline is located in the woods just before the Resort.<P>

	SSSP is held this year in the Baseball Diamond just east of the the Meadows Campground.  By 2012, the Meadows will have a service centre with flush toilets and showers.  SSSP has input into the design of the service centre, so red lights and window shutters are being included, so that the building will remain dark during SSSP activities.  However, the Meadows will also receive more streetlights.<P>

	It should be noted that the Cypress Hills Dark-Sky Preserve agreement does not limit development within the park, especially in the core area.  This means that new and renovated campgrounds can receive lighting provided it is compliant with dark-sky rules.  Thus all streetlights and lighting are full cut-off shielded, and all lights are turned off for the duration of the star party; as a minimum for the four official days, and often for the entire week preceding the star party.  The Meadows covers approximately 8 acres of a 197,000-acre dark-sky preserve.<P>

	If observing times other than the star party are desired, any area within the park can be used for that activity, though you cannot camp overnight in non-designated campgrounds.  You can, however, take advantage of camping and no lights in the Dark-Sky campground immediately northwest of the Meadows.  The campground contains 16 unpowered, unlit campsites. Since the Cypress Observatory is the home of a new observatory and Yurt classroom, some activity involving red light use may occur during interpretive programs, but otherwise, the site is very dark.<P>

	The Saskatchewan Light Pollution Abatement Committee, in conjunction with the SSSP, is working towards correcting non-complaint lighting that exists within the park.  To help out, join your local light pollution committee and become an active volunteer.<P>

           During the <B>16th Annual Saskatchewan Summer Star Party 2012, Comet P/2001 Q2 Petriew</B> returns to our sky. The comet was discovered at the 2001 SSSP by <B>Vance Petriew</B> of the Regina Centre of the RASC, and has now completed two orbits of the sun. Vance will be the <B>Father Lucian Kemble Memorial Lecture</B> speaker.  Although 2011 is the 10th anniversary of the discovery, SSSP has decided to wait until the comet returns to the summer sky to commemorate the event.

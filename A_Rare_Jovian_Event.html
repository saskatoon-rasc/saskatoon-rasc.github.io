AWESOME!</P></B><FONT SIZE=2><P>From:    Richard Huziak &lt;huziak@SEDSYSTEMS.CA&gt;</P><P>Posted on the RASClist, Fri, 11 Apr 2003 09:42</P><P>Well Bruce [McCurdy], I hope you saw it!  It was very cool!  I had noticed this event a few weeks ago while cruising through the Guide 7 simulations.  I picked up Jupiter just after 3:00UT (9 pm CST) and immediately saw Callisto (IV) already past the meridian.  It was very easy to see, and at first I thought it was the shadow of Io (I), but it was in the 'wrong' place for that.  Callisto appeared to be a medium grey colour, and so easily visible against the whiter clouds of the equatorial band.  Io's shadow was just past Jupiter's '1% dark crescent (terminator)' on the leading edge, and so still in the morning 'dusk'.  Once I realized this, it was easy to see, and very black.  The sky was not too good - thick haze - but I managed to pick out Io, almost on the meridian.  Io appeared to be a pale salmon colour against the clouds, so has far less contrast than Callisto.  At 360x, I could see that Io was only about 2/3 the size of Callisto.  Io's shadow (with penumbra) and Callisto were about the same size.  I watched over the next half-hour as the moon pair merged - Io travelling to Callisto, with Callisto barely moving, and several minutes before 9:30, the two were indistinguishable.  (Callisto ~1/2 occulted Io, but I could not distinguish the pair due to the poorer sky).  By now, the pair was entering the dusky area on the leading edge of Jupiter, and once Io left Callisto, I could not see it at all until it reached the very edge of the planet, and appeared as a gleaming disk before it actually budded off to black sky.  Callisto is so slow moving that I almost fell asleep watching it bud from the edge maybe a half-hour later, though that was cool, too.  As it left, it's greyness kept the moon 'dull' for a while until it cleared the glare of Jupiter.   I found the moons loose most of their colour once they hit dark sky again, likely due to the increased contrast - the subtle colours are easily visible against the cloud decks.</P><P>To make the event more exciting, just about the time the moons merged, the newer feature on the North Equatorial Band (NEB), which I fall the Little Red Spot, appeared, and following that was the greatly disturbed NEB waving in the wind.  This was fun to watch until Callisto's events were done.</P><P>I think you missed an event in your list, though.  Just past midnight, I believe that the occultations continued, with Io occulting Europa about 1 diameter off the leading edge of Jupiter.  My sky had died by that time, and I couldn't watch. :-(</P><P>Gord Sarty has kindly posted my sketches of yesterday's Jupiter mutual events at:</P><P>http://duke.usask.ca/~rasc/pdfs/RH_p6503-4.pdf</P><P>Note:  Geoff Gaherty responded: "What a great record of a beautiful set of events.

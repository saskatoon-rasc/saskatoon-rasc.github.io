In August 2009, come to the Cypress Hills Dark Sky Preserve and do something never done before at an RASC General Assembly:
 be armchair astronomers during the day and real astronomers at night!  We are delighted that the 2009 RASC General Assembly has
 been awarded to the Saskatoon Centre of the RASC. The 2009 GA will be held in conjunction with the Saskatchewan Summer Star Party.
 2009 is also the International Year of Astronomy and the 2009 GA will be held, for the first time, at a dark sky site.  It is our goal to provide
 an affordable, memorable GA where participants can observe under some of the darkest skies in Canada, and still enjoy the traditional social
 & business activities of a GA.<P> 

What better place to hold the GA than at the Cypress Hills Dark-Sky Preserve, with light pollution abatement featured as one of IYA's themes?
 The GA will include all the activities of past GAs but will also include observing and clinics under magnitude 7+ skies! Cabin, condo and hotel rooms
 are available. There is also ample room for tents and powered RV sites.<P>

Planned day-time events include a BBQ, the Ruth Northcott Lecture, solar observing, an IYA "Galileo Moment", scientific presentations and poster
 sessions, a Wine and Cheese reception, the Fr. Lucien Kemble Lecture, Banquet, tours of the Maple Creek Winery and Fort Walsh, National Council
 meetings and Annual Meeting. <P>

CHIPP and the Cypress Hills DSP are located in southwestern corner of Saskatchewan 30km south of Maple Creek on Hwy 21. Nearest fly-in centres
 are Saskatoon, Regina, Calgary (and possibly Medicine Hat, AB). Centre Representatives who are planning to fly in for the weekend should book into
 Saskatoon (YXE) where they will be met, housed, fed and transported to and from the GA/SSSP 2009 by kind, friendly Saskatoon Centre chaperones.
 We will have some loaner telescopes and camping equipment available for reps that cannot bring their own.  For those who can fly into Saskatoon
 on Tuesday August 11, we have arranged a tour of the Canadian Light Source (the "synchrotron") at the University of Saskatchewan  campus on Tuesday
 evening.<P>

In previous years, some attendees have arrived at the Park in the week preceeding the SSSP to enjoy the dark skies in a nearly empty Meadows Campground.
This year, the New Moon is on the 20th of the month, on the Thursday the week following the event.  Dark skies to 02:00 (moonrise) are available starting the
 Sunday night of the GA/SSSP.  We suggest that those who wish to enjoy the moonless dark skies of the Park stay later rather than come early.

For more information, contact the GA/SSSP organizing committee at: <A href="mailto:sssp.sk@sasktel.net">sssp.sk@sasktel.net</A>.

                There is a lot of room to camp at the Meadows Campground, where all the observing will occur.
                <B>ALL campsites in Meadows, including powered and unpowered sites, are RUSH: FIRST COME, FIRST SERVE
                from Thursday through Sunday.</B>
                When you arrive at the Park, register at the Camping Office, self-identify yourself as a member of the GA/SSSP
                 and tell the staff that you want to camp in the Meadows Campground.
                Pay the appropriate camping fees.<B>  If you are camping in the Meadows you must have a valid 
                camping permit for a tenting or powered site.</B><P>

                <B>Note that the Campground Office will assign campsites only as you arrive.
                You will not be able to book ahead for any site within the Meadows for Thursday through Sunday.</B>
                The on-line booking system for the Park will show the Meadows as completely full for those 4 days.
                There has been some confusion over this in the past,
                but the GA/SSSP follows standard park rules for use of the Meadows and does not receive any special
                deal or treatment.  Please do not try to convince the Campground staff otherwise.  If the park
                changes their policy in the future, so will the GA/SSSP.<P>

                <B>If you want to set up with the main group of participants</B> you will want to set up in powered
                campsites #31, #33 through #65, camp in the unpowered open area of the Meadows or in the ~ 40
                unpowered campsites within the trees on the west, east and south parts of the field, or anywhere on
                the open field.<P>

                You cannot tent on a powered site unless you have paid the power fee.  If you'd rather be secluded, 
                you can chose a camping spot between the road and the trees: campsites #1 through #9, #25 through #30
                & #38.<P>

                <B>GA/SSSP does NOT pay for anyone's camping or power - this is your responsibility.</B>
                Park rules for the number of tents per site apply - check with the Campground Office for more
                information.<P>

                Note that the Meadows is a slightly more rustic campsite with water taps, outhouses, fire-pits,
                picnic tables and both treed and open camping sites. There is no service centre in the Meadows
                campground. Service centres with showers and flush toilets are available at Rainbow and Terrace
                campgrounds, a 7-minute walk or 2-minute drive from Meadows.<P>

                If you wish to come to the Park before the GA/SSSP starts, for example on Wednesday, you can book
                a limited number of sites, the "Reserve-a-Site" campsites #10 through #24.  They  are located between
                the road and trees. These can be booked in advance Monday to Friday during regular business hours, 
                but they are away from the main group of observers.<B>  If you wish to keep that site through the
                GA/SSSP weekend, you will have to self-identify yourself as a member of the GA/SSSP.  
                Contact the Reserve-a-Site 
                office at 306-662-5484.</B>  You can always set up your telescope in the main field and just leave it set up
                for the duration, and still camp away from the group.<P>

                <B>Meadows rates are:</B> 
                <UL>
                  <LI>Non-powered sites: $15 per night (w/o service centre) 
                  <LI>Powered site: $20 per night (w/o service centre) 
                </UL>
                If you want to camp elsewhere, away from the event in Rainbow, Terrace or Warlodge campgrounds,
                these are the fees: 
                <UL>
                  <LI>Camping elsewhere non-powered site: $22 per night (c/w service centre) 
                  <LI>Camping elsewhere powered site: $26 per night (c/w service centre)</LI>
                </UL><P>

               These rates are current as of January 1, 2009.  For current rates, check the Saskatchewan Parks website at 
               <A HREF="http://www.tpcs.gov.sk.ca/fees">http://www.tpcs.gov.sk.ca/fees</A>.<P>

                Due to space and power capacity requests, we request that those who occupy a powered site share
                their power plugs & possibly allow tenting on the corners of your site. You may run extension cord
                from the power pole, but you should offer a "sublet" fee to whoever is renting the power. Do not
                exceed the power rating of the breaker.<P>

                CHIPP allows you to set up an equipment tent free of charge if you are staying in the resort or
                camping away from the Meadows. If you do this you must place a note on the tent that states
                equipment tent only - no campers or else park permit staff may insist you pay the tenting fee.
                Any disputes over payment of camping frees are between YOU and CHIPP. Park personnel may check
                camping permits at any time.<P>

              <B>The GA/SSSP is a Red-Light Only Zone from sundown to sun-up.</B>  We are not unique: all star parties                        insist on <B>no white lights</B> to preserve night vision for participants.  If you are a new attendee                        or do not understand these regulations, ask a star party organizer for assistance.<P>	      

              <B>White light flashlights are NOT allowed!</B>  Use <B>only</B> red filtered flashlights, and keep them                      as dim as possible.<P>

              Please make sure to have your car parked in its final resting position well before darkness sets in.  If                      you do not intend to remain in the Meadows all night long, park and set up near to the entrance                               gate so you can leave without blinding everybody!</B>  Cars are to use their park-lights only, or be lead                     with their lights off by someone with a red flashlight.  (This is not advised for safety reasons and to                       be used only in an emergency). Gate security people will have a limited supply of red flags to cover car                      lights.  Cover the following lights: interior, back-up, license plate, trunk and headlights.  Gate                            security people will tape red flags your vehicle lights at the gate as you arrive.  Please cover windows                      on RVs as not to accidentally have a family member flash the crowd with white light.  The most common                         offending light issues with vehicles are interior dome lights and uncovered backup lights coming on                           unexpectedly.<P>

              Red and green lasers are permitted.  Do not point them horizontally at people or trailers!  Lasers will                       not show on astrophotos unless they are held in the same place for many seconds. Use them sparingly.                          Lasers will be used extensively during the scheduled starwalks from 10:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m Friday and                        Saturday night.<P>

              The GA/SSSP Committee welcomes astronomy (and related) dealers to set up booths at the GA/SSSP.  At this event you have the potential to reach nearly 300 astronomy enthusiasts just looking to buy something.<P>  

To participate, you are asked to follow the standard registration procedure - i.e. vendors must register as normal participants at the normal costs for the star party.  You may in turn sell and conduct normal business within the Meadows campground (but due to Park restrictions cannot solicit elsewhere in the park.)  The GA/SSSP is not responsible for any of the vendor's business costs (transportation, accommodation, living, etc.) Vendors are responsible for their own arrangements, park entry and must pay standard camping fees (to the Park) and camp site power if needed, if staying in the Meadows.  The GA/SSSP is not responsible for any merchandise loss or damage.  As registered GA/SSSP star party goers, all vendors are welcome to participate in all activities they have registered for.<P>

If you would like to donate a door prize, this will be graciously accepted & will be accordingly acknowledged, though a door prize donation is not required and is at the discretion of the vendor.  Vendors will receive a free 1/4-page ad in the star party handout literature or for $25 can purchase a full-page ad.  (Ads in the GA/SSSP handout are gray-scale photocopied and are not in colour).  Alternately, the GA/SSSP will pre-package vendor-supplied product brochures in our registration folders for 25 cents per copy.  Approximately 120 registration packages are handed out.  Vendor must provide the ad or the product brochures at least 2 weeks prior to the star party.  (Mail to or contact the Registrars).<P>

In a further attempt to foster this on-going good will, all star party vendors will be entitled to two separate half-page ads (or equivalent - e.g. four 1/4-page ads) in our monthly newsletter, over the coming year.  These ads are at no additional cost.  Our current newsletter circulation is approximately 80 copies, but these are highly targeted readers & the newsletters are also on-line.  All ads are subject to approval by the Saskatoon Centre Executive before inclusion in the newsletter.  We will do our best to publish the ad in the month desired, but this is also subject to available space within the newsletter.<P>

              The GA/SSSP will offer <B>complete refunds</B> for registration costs and prepaid activities, without a handling fee, to participants who wish to withdraw from the GA/SSSP prior to the start of the star party and for <B><I>no-show</I></B> participants <B>except as follows.</B>  GA/SSSP cannot refund the prepaid banquet costs within 48-hours of the banquet (ie. after 5:00 p.m. on the preceding Thursday) since the GA/SSSP locks in their banquet costs to the Resort at that time.  If shirts are pre-ordered, the GA/SSSP may not be able to cancel shirt orders within 3 weeks of the star party.  If possible, refunds for shirts will be made, but if cancellation is not possible, shirts will be mailed out at the withdrawing participant’s cost after the star party.  No shows are defined as those who have not registered by the end of registration period on the Saturday afternoon of the star party.<P>

<B>However, banquet tickets are always in demand right up to the starting minute of the banquet!</B>  There is almost always a waiting list since banquet seating space is limited.  If you have not made previous arrangements and find that at the last minute you cannot come to the star party or cannot attend the banquet, <B>please telephone us at 306-343-9836 or 306-222-0515</B> (star party cells) <B>and let us know if you will release your banquet tickets for resale.</B>  If we can resell your banquet tickets, we will refund the entire cost to you, even within the 48-hour no-refund window.  Someone at the star party will be delighted that you thought of them!  Otherwise, your tickets will be held for you assuming you will show up at the last minute and are thus not otherwise refundable.<P>

            If you have not been to the Cypress Hills Inter-provincial Park, 
            you are missing something! This is a beautiful park, nested in 
            Lodgepole pines on a butte that reaches 1460 meters above sea level, 
            and is the highest point in Canada between the Rockies and Labrador. 
            (Because of the altitude - bring warm clothes for night time!) Its 
            unique position gives it an unusual weather advantage. Historical 
            weather maps published by Jay Anderson in the RASC Observer's 
            Handbook indicate that the area around Cypress Hills has the best 
            chance for clear skies (less than 30 percent mean nighttime cloud 
            cover) in July and August compared to any other site in Canada.  Also,
            no mosquitos!<P>
            The park is very modern and well equipped for families of tired 
            astronomers. The park features a lake, hiking trails, paddle boats, 
            mini golf, regular golf, a general store, a full resort, two 
            restaurants, an ice-cream and snack shop, a souvenir shop, moose and 
            other varmints (no snakes or big cats), ball diamonds, picnic 
            grounds, tennis courts, an outdoor heated pool, hot tub, a museum 
            and of course, the GA/SSSP! More on the park is found at:

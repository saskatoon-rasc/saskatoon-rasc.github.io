                    the T-shirt logo design, pin design, banquet, etc.  We are maintaining a waiting list for accommodations at the Resort.

          <TD>June 21, 2009:
              <UL>
	<LI>The earlier posted dates have now changed!  We are back <b>August 12-15, 2010.</b><p>
	Originally we had chosen really poor dates of Aug 26 - 29 due to park accommodation 
	and venue conflicts and trying not to overlay others' dates for star parties.  After we re-checked
	with the Park and Resort, there were new circumstances that now allowed us to book into better
	dark-sky dates - beginning just a few days after new moon.<p>
	Three people are booked into the old dates with the Resort.  We will contact those three
	to rebook, and the resort assures us that there will be no transfer fees.<p>
	One issue is that we will be low on resort accommodations, having approximately 1/2 of what we 
	normally have available for hotel and condo rooms; no cabins are available. 
	So book early if you intend to come (and you can cancel without penalty later if things change.)
	We will also try to maintain a waiting list with the Resort should we need one.  For those new
	to SSSP - there is a MOUNTAIN of camping space available in the Meadows Campground where the 
	observing is held.

                   <TD><FONT size=+1><B>Stan Shadick</B>: Department of Physics and Engineering Physics, University of Saskatchewan.</FONT>&nbsp;&nbsp;Stan Shadick developed his passion for astronomy as a youth from discussions with teachers and members of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada. After deciding to pursue a career in astronomy, he earned an Honours B.Sc. in physics from the University of Saskatchewan and a M.Sc. in astronomy from the University of Western Ontario.  He currently teaches introductory and advanced astronomy courses at the University of Saskatchewan. He designed most of the courses in their astronomy minor program and supervises its 3 observatories. In his free time, he contributes observations of exoplanet transits to an international database.  He is the author of the <I><B>Skywatchers 2011</B></I> calendar, now in its 15th edition. He also writes an astronomy column for the <I>Saskatoon Sun</I>.<P>

Stan's Fr. Lucien Kemble Memorial Lecture is titled&nbsp;<I><B>Investigating Exoplanets with Small Telescopes.</B></I>&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1988, three astronomers from western Canada published the first confirmed discovery of a planet in orbit around a star other than the Sun. Since then, more than 450 exoplanets have been discovered in over 380 planetary systems. This talk will review what we have learned about the properties of these planets. It will then focus on how amateur astronomers can use cameras attached to their own telescopes to measure the size of these planets and how amateurs may contribute to the search for additional exoplanets or even exomoons.<P>

Stan Shadick will be signing copies of his <I><B>Skywatchers 2011</B></I> calendar at the Meadows Campground from 11:30 to 12:00 Saturday morning near the Swap Table.

                Our room block at the Resort runs from Thursday through Saturday nights.
                Due to the change in SSSP dates for this year, and on-going renovations of the cabins at the Resort, our room block is about 1/2 of what we 
	  normally have available.  We are maintaining a waiting list for people who wish to find accommodations in the Resort.  Contact our Registrar Rick Huziak 
                at (306) 665-3392 or sssp.sk@sasktel.net.  Do NOT ask the Resort to place you on their waiting list: they do not maintain a waiting list of their own.
                Please contact our Registrar if there are no accommodations available when you call them.<P>
 
                Contact the Resort at 306-662-4477.&nbsp;&nbsp;

                <B>If you are camping in the Meadows you must have a valid camping permit for a tenting 
                or powered site.</B><P> 

                There is a lot of room to camp at the Meadows Campground, where all the observing will occur. 
                <B>All campsites in Meadows are RUSH: FIRST COME, FIRST SERVE, except for 15 Reserve-a-Site spots
                described below.</B>  When you arrive at the park, register at the Camping Office.  Tell the
                Campground Office that you are with the star party that you want to camp in the Meadows Campground.
                Pay the appropriate camping fees.<P>

                Note that the Meadows is a slightly more rustic campsite with water taps, outhouses, fire-pits,
                picnic tables and both treed and open camping sites. There is no service centre in the Meadows
                campground. Service centres with showers and flush toilets are available at Rainbow and Terrace
                campgrounds, a 7-minute walk or 2-minute drive from Meadows.<P>

                <B>SSSP does NOT pay for anyone's camping or power - this is your responsibility.</B>
                Park rules for the number of tents per site apply - check with the Campground Office for more
                information.<P>

                <B>If you want to set up with the main group of participants</B> you will want to set up in powered
                campsites #31, #33 through #65, camp in the unpowered open area of the Meadows or in the ~ 40
                unpowered campsites within the trees on the west, east and south parts of the field, or anywhere on
                the open field.<P>

                <B>Note that the Campground Office will assign powered site campsites only as you arrive and only
                the 15 powered Reserve-a-Sites in advance.</B>  There has been some confusion over this in the past,
                but the SSSP follows standard park rules for use of the Meadows and does not receive any special
                deal or treatment.  Please do not try to convince the Campground staff otherwise.  If the park
                changes their policy in the future, so will the SSSP.<P>

                You cannot tent on a powered site unless you have paid the power fee.  If you'd rather be secluded,
                you can chose a camping spot between the road and the trees: campsites #1 through #9, #25 through #30
                & #38.<P>

                <B>Reserve-a-Site campsites #10 through #24</B> are also located between the road and trees. These
                can be booked in advance Monday to Friday during regular business hours, but they are away from the
                main group of observers. <B>Contact the Reserve-a-Site office at 306-662-5484.</B>   You can always
                set up your telescope in the main field and just leave it set up for the duration, and still camp
                away from the group.<P>

                <B>The Saskatchewan Tourism has now implemented differential fee rates for out-of-province campers.</B><P>           

                <B>Rates for Saskatchewan campers are:</B> 
                <UL>
                  <LI>Meadows non-powered sites: $15 per night

                <UL>
                  <LI>Meadows non-powered sites: $19 per night

                Current Saskatchewan park fees are available at:<A HREF="http://www.tpcs.gov.sk.ca/fees">http://www.tpcs.gov.sk.ca/fees</A>.<P>

                Due to space and power capacity requests, we request that those who occupy a powered site share
                their power plugs & possibly allow tenting on the corners of your site. You may run extension cord
                from the power pole, but you should offer a "sublet" fee to whoever is renting the power. Do not
                exceed the power rating of the breaker.<P>

                CHIPP allows you to set up an equipment tent free of charge if you are staying in the resort or
                camping away from the Meadows. If you do this you must place a note on the tent that states
                equipment tent only - no campers or else park permit staff may insist you pay the tenting fee.
                Any disputes over payment of camping frees are between YOU and CHIPP. Park personnel may check
                camping permits at any time.<P>

                <B>Near Future Changes to Meadows Campground</B><P>

                SSSP guests should be aware that the Meadows campground will undergo major changes over the 2010 and 2011 seasons.
                In spring 2010, the Park will begin expanding the camping area by adding roads and developing 80 new campsites that will be 
                electrified, bringing the total to 128 electrified sites by 2011.  After Labour Day 2010 (post-star party), construction of a central 
                service centre and additional vault toilets will begin.  The service centre will include hot showers and flush toilets and should be 
                open for the 2011 star party.  Other changes include additional trees and streetlights (that will be off during the star party week).
                Should construction be in progress during the star party, SSSP will inform our guests in advance of any potential hazards.

              The major door prizes are awarded by drawing names out of a container.  The following rules apply to               the major door prize awards.  These rules will be strictly followed.
              <UL>
                 <LI>All SSSP attendees will have their names in the draw regardless of whether or not they                                 have previously won a minor door prize.
                 <LI>YOU MUST BE IN ATTENDANCE IN THE ROOM WHEN THE DRAW IS MADE. The time of                      the draw is posted on the schedule.
                 <LI>Only the exact person whos name is drawn can accept the prize, and that person must accept the                      prize immediately at the front of the room. No one else may represent the winner or hold their                        ticket.
                 <LI>If the person who's name is called does not claim the prize immediately the person will be                            declared a non-winner, and a draw for a new winner will be conducted immediately, and the same                        rules apply.

              <B>The SSSP is a Red-Light Only Zone from sundown to sun-up.</B>  We are not unique: all star parties                        insist on <B>no white lights</B> to preserve night vision for participants.  If you are a new attendee                        or do not understand these regulations, ask a star party organizer for assistance.<P>	      

              <B>White light flashlights are NOT allowed!</B>  Use <B>only</B> red filtered flashlights, and keep them                      as dim as possible.<P>

              Please make sure to have your car parked in its final resting position well before darkness sets in.  If                      you do not intend to remain in the Meadows all night long, park and set up near to the entrance                               gate so you can leave without blinding everybody!</B>  Cars are to use their park-lights only, or be lead                     with their lights off by someone with a red flashlight.  (This is not advised for safety reasons and to                       be used only in an emergency). Gate security people will have a limited supply of red flags to cover car                      lights.  Cover the following lights: interior, back-up, license plate, trunk and headlights.  Gate                            security people will tape red flags your vehicle lights at the gate as you arrive.  Please cover windows                      on RVs as not to accidentally have a family member flash the crowd with white light.  The most common                         offending light issues with vehicles are interior dome lights and uncovered backup lights coming on                           unexpectedly.<P>

              Red and green lasers are permitted.  Do not point them horizontally at people or trailers!  Lasers will                       not show on astrophotos unless they are held in the same place for many seconds. Use them sparingly.                          Lasers will be used extensively during the scheduled starwalks from 10:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m Friday and                        Saturday night.<P>

              The SSSP Committee welcomes astronomy (and related) dealers to set up booths at the SSSP.  At this event you have the potential to reach nearly 300 astronomy enthusiasts just looking to buy something.<P>  

To participate, you are asked to follow the standard registration procedure - i.e. vendors must register as normal participants at the normal costs for the star party.  You may in turn sell and conduct normal business within the Meadows campground (but due to Park restrictions cannot solicit elsewhere in the park.)  The SSSP is not responsible for any of the vendor’s business costs (transportation, accommodation, living, etc.) Vendors are responsible for their own arrangements, park entry and must pay standard camping fees (to the Park) and camp site power if needed, if staying in the Meadows.  The SSSP is not responsible for any merchandise loss or damage.  As registered SSSP star party goers, all vendors are welcome to participate in all activities they have registered for.<P>

If you would like to donate a door prize, this will be graciously accepted & will be accordingly acknowledged, though a door prize donation is not required and is at the discretion of the vendor.  Vendors will receive a free 1/4-page ad in the star party handout literature or for $25 can purchase a full-page ad.  (Ads in the SSSP handout are gray-scale photocopied and are not in colour).  Alternately, the SSSP will pre-package vendor-supplied product brochures in our registration folders for 25 cents per copy.  Approximately 120 registration packages are handed out.  Vendor must provide the ad or the product brochures at least 2 weeks prior to the star party.  (Mail to or contact the Registrars).<P>

In a further attempt to foster this on-going good will, all star party vendors will be entitled to two separate half-page ads (or equivalent - e.g. four 1/4-page ads) in our monthly newsletter, over the coming year.  These ads are at no additional cost.  Our current newsletter circulation is approximately 80 copies, but these are highly targeted readers & the newsletters are also on-line.  All ads are subject to approval by the Saskatoon Centre Executive before inclusion in the newsletter.  We will do our best to publish the ad in the month desired, but this is also subject to available space within the newsletter.<P>

If shirts are pre-ordered, the SSSP may not be able to cancel shirt orders within 3 weeks of the star party.  If possible, refunds for shirts will be made, but if cancellation is not possible, shirts will be mailed out at the withdrawing participant’s cost after the star party.  No shows are defined as those who have not registered by the end of registration period on the Saturday afternoon of the star party.<P>

<B>However, banquet tickets are always in demand right up to the starting minute of the banquet!</B>  There is almost always a waiting list since banquet seating space is limited.  If you have not made previous arrangements and find that at the last minute you cannot come to the star party or cannot attend the banquet, <B>please telephone us at 306-280-9836</B> (star party cell) <B>and let us know if you will release your banquet tickets for resale.</B>  If we can resell your banquet tickets, we will refund the entire cost to you, even within the 48-hour no-refund window.  Someone at the star party will be delighted that you thought of them!  Otherwise, your tickets will be held for you assuming you will show up at the last minute and are thus not otherwise refundable.<P>

            If you have not been to the Cypress Hills Inter-provincial Park, 
            you are missing something! This is a beautiful park, nested in 
            Lodgepole pines on a butte that reaches 1460 meters above sea level, 
            and is the highest point in Canada between the Rockies and Labrador. 
            (Because of the altitude - bring warm clothes for night time!) Its 
            unique position gives it an unusual weather advantage. Historical 
            weather maps published by Jay Anderson in the RASC Observer's 
            Handbook indicate that the area around Cypress Hills has the best 
            chance for clear skies (less than 30 percent mean nighttime cloud 
            cover) in July and August compared to any other site in Canada.  Also,
            no mosquitos!<P>
            The park is very modern and well equipped for families of tired 
            astronomers. The park features a lake, hiking trails, paddle boats, 
            mini golf, regular golf, a general store, a full resort, two 
            restaurants, an ice-cream and snack shop, a souvenir shop, moose and 
            other varmints (no snakes or big cats), ball diamonds, picnic 
            grounds, tennis courts, an outdoor heated pool, hot tub, a museum 
            and of course, the SSSP! More on the park is found at:

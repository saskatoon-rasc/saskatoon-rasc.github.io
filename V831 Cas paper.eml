Hi Gordon,

I finally got an opportunity to sit down in a quite corner and read through 
the V831 Cas paper - sorry for that. Here are my notes:

- Abstract, 3rd line: remove "known" (it's already there in the 2nd line)
- last line: dusk -> disk
- Intro, first sentence: too long.
- 9th line: classification ... are -> class ... is that of the
- p.2, Table 1 -> move table caption to the top of the Table (and in all other 
Tables as well)
- 3rd line in Sect. 2.1: Johnston -> Johnson
- the last few sentences in Sect. 2.1: this mixture of data reductions may 
open a range of criticism from a not-so-friedly referee. Some discussion of 
why this was acceptable would be helpful to avoid that. 
- p.3., Fig.2. It's a bit messy. For example, why wasn't the last chunk of 
data shown in the bottom panel? Right now the lowest one precedes the one 
above it. The different time-spans of the panels are a bit confusing. Somehow 
the overview of the light curve could be nicer. 
- p.4, "relatively neutral B-V" in Fig. 1. Why "neutral"? These all have 
similar colour indices as V831 Cas, with good chances of being cluster 
members and in that case being similarly B type stars. 
- Fig.3: there is not much significant colour variation at all. Is it really 
worth putting a whole figure that doesn't show anything? 
- lower left corner in p.4: Echelle design ... 1st specral order.
I don't understand it. Echelle spectrographs are usually used in high spectral 
orders, allowing the detection of many spectral orders thanks to a cross 
disperser. Wasn't that an ordinary Cassegrain spectrograph? A few sentences 
before that is told. 
- 6th line before Sect. 2.2. ends: The spectra were extracted and wavelength 
calibrated against the emission lines from an Fe-Ar lamp...
- p.5, Fig. 4: labels of spectral lines above the top spectrum would help
- p.5, Fig.5: the outbursts seems to be placed quite equidistantly - was there 
any attempt to derive a mean recurrence time? Any periodicity in the X-ray 
outbursts?
- 6th line in Sect. 3.3: compatable -> compatible
- the three discussions of frequencies would probably be more readable in a 
Table, in which we compare different solutions. 
- pp.6-7, Sect. 3.4 contains some statements, which sound a bit overconfident 
to me. Like the one at the end that "we can conclude without a doubt that the 
orbital period is of the order of 1 day, not 300 days..."

I think we can drop the doubts only if we measure the orbital period. We have 
not been able to do so because of the limited spectroscopic dataset. chi2 
values of 33-36  would cause anyone to laugh at us if we used Fig. 8 to claim 
that there is no doubt at all about the orbital period's range. What if the 
Be star does something weird? If you look, for example, at zeta Oph's MOST 
paper and cited references, B/Be stars can have all kinds of periodicities 
from all kinds of different mechanisms. I doubt that we can assume that Fig. 
8 reflects only orbital motion, excluding all other possibilities.

- I believe the calculations in Sect. 4 are correct, what puzzles me is how 
compatible are all those X-ray data in the literature with a rapidly spinning 
white dwarf. Is there really place to change an NS to a WD without changing 
drastically the interpretation of decades of X-ray data? It's seems to be a 
huge change, by maybe I'm wrong - I'm nowhere near an expert in the field.
If the star is member of a cluster, there is presumably an age estimate. Was 
there enough time to form a WD within that age? NSs can from quickly from the 
massive progenitors, but what about the youngest WDs known (in other open 
clusters)? Are they compatible with the age estimate of V831 Cas?

These are the things that come to my mind in a first read. I may ask too much, 
please treat all my notes only as an attempt to be a hostile referee.

Laszlo

A long time member of the RASC and an accomplished observer, Rick has completed over 14,500 professional quality  observations. Rick has made other significant contributions to variable star observing, including improvements to the accuracy of star charts, and actively encouraging other observers.  Recently, he has brought to the attention of the astronomical community the large number of variable stars that appear to be mislabeled or missing in the &quot;Millenium Star Atlas.&quot;  The American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) has also recognized his valuable contributions, by awarding him with an AAVSO Observer Award in 1999.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>The Chant Medal is the most prestigious award given to amateur astronomers in Canada.  The medal is awarded, not more than once a year, to an amateur astronomy resident in Canada for a significant and valuable piece of work of an extensive nature carried out in astronomy and closely allied fields.  The award was established in 1940, and has been awarded only 24 times before 2001.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>Rick has been a member of the RASC since 1977, and has been actively involved in many of the observational and organisational activities of the Saskatoon Centre.  He has served on the Saskatoon Centre Executive in many positions, most notably as President from 1993 to 1997.  His observational skills, in the opinion of most members, are exceptional to the point of being legendary, and he gives much of his time to freely impart his knowledge and skill to newer members and assist in their development as observers.  His commitment to public outreach and education is amply demonstrated by the over 1100 talks and presentations he has made over the last 15 years to groups as diverse as elementary school classes, Beaver Creek Conservation Authority public star parties, and the Saskatoon Engineering Society.  He has been a volunteer fireball investigator with the Canadian Space Agency's Meteorites and Impacts Advisory Committee, and an active member of the RASC's Light Pollution Abatement Committee and the International Dark Sky Association.</P> <!-- AND NEW DATA ENDS HERE --> </font></td></table></td></tr></table></body></html>

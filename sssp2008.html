                   <TD><FONT size=+1><B>Alan Whitman.</B></FONT>&nbsp;&nbsp;Retired from the Canadian Meteorological Service, Alan Whitman is a full-time amateur astronomer.  Four magazines have published his observing articles, including thirteen in Sky&Telescope. He writes the text in The Sky Month by
Month section in the RASC Observer's Handbook, as well as its Southern-Hemisphere Splendours list. In 2007 he wrote about one-fifth of the 576-page book Astronomica for an Australian publisher. He founded the predecessor club to the Okanagan Centre in 1980, and the Mt. Kobau Star Party in 1984. Many RASC centres and star parties have invited him to be a speaker.<P>
Alan's Fr. Lucien Kemble Lecture is titled <B>"Dark Site Observing with the Unaided Eye"</B>:&nbsp;Many details can be seen in the marbled Milky Way from a fine dark site like SSSP with just the unaided eye: star clouds, dark nebulae, and clusters. The main emphasis will be on the naked-eye dark nebulae that can be identified in the summer Milky Way by a careful observer on the best nights, but there will also be some mention of the glorious view of our galaxy that can be seen from the southern hemisphere. The talk will also cover some of the bright open clusters away from the Milky Way, naked-eye variable stars, as well as the zodiacal light, zodiacal band, and Gegenschein. While only objects that are visible with the unaided eye will be discussed, binoculars are a natural extension of naked-eye observing so the appearance of some objects through ordinary 7x50s will also be mentioned.<P>
Alan has graciously agreed to give an observing clinic Saturday evening that will complement and illustrate the points he will have covered in his Fr. Lucien Kemble lecture of Saturday afternoon.
<P>
The star party organizers gratefully acknowledge the generous support of <B><I>Sasktel</I></B> for the Fr. Lucien Kemble Memorial Lecture.

He is a contributing editor to SkyNews and to Sky and Telescope magazines and appears frequently on local and national news media explaining astronomy and space science news. Asteroid 78434 is named for him.<P>
Alan's talk is titled <B>"The Amazing Sky"</B>:&nbsp;Using astronomical images and time-lapse movies he has taken from western Canada and from around the world, Alan takes us on a visual tour of the wonders of  the night sky, from spectacular sights anyone can see to objects visible only with the aid of telescopes, such as will be available for public use in the Park this weekend. Alan will highlight some of the special events and objects to look for in the  
sky above us tonight and in the next few evenings.

He observes visually and records celestial objects by scratching carbon sticks against flattened sheets of tree fibre. He became an astronomer during the 1979 total eclipse of the sun, makes scale models of historical spacecraft, and plays a variety of instruments in several Winnipeg-based bands.
<P>
Scott's talk is titled <B>"The Galileo Moment: Discovery and the International Year of Astronomy"</B>:&nbsp;In 1609, Galileo's telescopic observations revolutionized science. Four centuries later, we prepare to celebrate the universe during the International year of Astronomy. How can we help Canadians have their own "Galileo Moment", that moment of discovery through the telescope that expands the mind and triggers awe in the viewer? How can our public events attract today's media-savvy audience of cynical youth? And should we bother?

He was President of the Edmonton center in 1991-1992, and has presented A Binocular Star walk at the Mt. Kobau Star Party since the early 90s.
<P>
Murray's observing Friday evening observing clinic it titled <B>"Imaging the Planets with the New Generation Cameras"</B>: Murray Paulson is an avid planetary observer, and imager. In 2003, he swapped his drawing pad and pencil for a web camera based imager, the Phillips Toucam. [He has never looked back!] The post processing of a video file is the low cost answer to adaptive optics, and the results are truly astounding and affordable. The technique involves capturing a video of the planet to the hard drive on your computer, processing that file with some specialized software, (freeware!).  The software determines the image motion from frame to frame and image quality. It then stacks and aligns all the frames up ignoring the low quality ones. The final product is a great image that often shows more details than were apparent even in the eyepiece.  Murray Paulson will show the equipment and techniques involved in planetary imaging, and demonstrate the post processing of those images. Cameras from the Imaging source will be demonstrated.  If weather  trumps the occasion, we will demonstrate the equipment and the processing of images from previous days imaging sessions. This will be a hands-on session.

              The Resort catering staff will be serving the "Classic" buffet.  This is a change from last year.  After our prices were set for this year, the Resort increased the prices on all of their catered meals. So that we could hold to the published price for the banquet this year, we had to go for the "Classic Buffet" rather than the "Loch Lomond Buffet" that we usually have served.  The banquet is served in the Wapiti Room.  It starts at 6:00 pm Saturday.  Costs for the banquet are the same as last year: Adults, $23; Children 4-11 yr, $12.<P>
There are only 180 places for the banquet.  They will be allocated on a "first registered, first allocated" basis.  <B>We strongly suggest that you preorder your tickets when you send in your registration.</B>  A limited number of places will be held for at-the-door registrations but only if the 180 place limit has not yet been exceeded.<P>
We also ask you, if you find that you are not able to come to the banquet but have preordered tickets, to contact us immediately.  We will refund your banquet ticket costs and will allocate your tickets to people on our waiting list.  <B>If you do not contact us beforehand and you do not show up, your banquet ticket costs will NOT be refunded.</B>  See "Refund Policy" for more information.<P>

                <B>If you are camping in the Meadows you must have a valid camping permit for a tenting 
                or powered site.</B><P> 

                There is a lot of room to camp at the Meadows Campground, where all the observing will occur. 
                <B>All campsites in Meadows are RUSH: FIRST COME, FIRST SERVE, except for 15 Reserve-a-Site spots
                described below.</B>  When you arrive at the park, register at the Camping Office.  Tell the
                Campground Office that you are with the star party that you want to camp in the Meadows Campground.
                Pay the appropriate camping fees.<P>

                Note that the Meadows is a slightly more rustic campsite with water taps, outhouses, fire-pits,
                picnic tables and both treed and open camping sites. There is no service centre in the Meadows
                campground. Service centres with showers and flush toilets are available at Rainbow and Terrace
                campgrounds, a 7-minute walk or 2-minute drive from Meadows.<P>

                <B>SSSP does NOT pay for anyone's camping or power - this is your responsibility.</B>
                Park rules for the number of tents per site apply - check with the Campground Office for more
                information.<P>

                <B>If you want to set up with the main group of participants</B> you will want to set up in powered
                campsites #31, #33 through #65, camp in the unpowered open area of the Meadows or in the ~ 40
                unpowered campsites within the trees on the west, east and south parts of the field, or anywhere on
                the open field.<P>

                <B>Note that the Campground Office will assign powered site campsites only as you arrive and only
                the 15 powered Reserve-a-Sites in advance.</B>  There has been some confusion over this in the past,
                but the SSSP follows standard park rules for use of the Meadows and does not receive any special
                deal or treatment.  Please do not try to convince the Campground staff otherwise.  If the park
                changes their policy in the future, so will the SSSP.<P>

                You cannot tent on a powered site unless you have paid the power fee.  If you'd rather be secluded,                   you can chose a camping spot between the road and the trees: campsites #1 through #9, #25 through #30
                & #38.<P>

                <B>Reserve-a-Site campsites #10 through #24</B> are also located between the road and trees. These
                can be booked in advance Monday to Friday during regular business hours, but they are away from the
                main group of observers. <B>Contact the Reserve-a-Site office at 306-662-5484.</B>   You can always
                set up your telescope in the main field and just leave it set up for the duration, and still camp
                away from the group.<P>

                <B>Meadows rates are:</B> 

                <P>(Rates are current as of March 10.)

                <UL>
                  <LI>Non-powered sites: $13 per night (w/o service centre) 
                  <LI>Powered site: $18 per night (w/o service centre) 
                  <LI>Firewood permit (optional - your choice): daily - $3, 3-day - $5, weekly - $15</LI>
                </UL>
                If you want to camp elsewhere, away from the event in Rainbow, Terrace or Warlodge campgrounds,
                these are the fees: 
                <UL>
                  <LI>Camping elsewhere non-powered site: $15 per night (c/w service centre) 
                  <LI>Camping elsewhere powered site: $20 per night (c/w service centre)</LI>
                </UL>

                Current Saskatchewan park fees are available at:<A HREF="http://www.tpcs.gov.sk.ca/fees">                http://www.tpcs.gov.sk.ca/fees</A>.<P>

                Due to space and power capacity requests, we request that those who occupy a powered site share
                their power plugs & possibly allow tenting on the corners of your site. You may run extension cord
                from the power pole, but you should offer a "sublet" fee to whoever is renting the power. Do not
                exceed the power rating of the breaker.<P>

                CHIPP allows you to set up an equipment tent free of charge if you are staying in the resort or
                camping away from the Meadows. If you do this you must place a note on the tent that states
                equipment tent only - no campers or else park permit staff may insist you pay the tenting fee.
                Any disputes over payment of camping frees are between YOU and CHIPP. Park personnel may check
                camping permits at any time.<P>

Gate security people will have a limited supply of red flags to cover car                      lights.  Cover the following lights: interior, back-up, license plate, trunk and headlights.  Gate                            security people will tape red flags your vehicle lights at the gate as you arrive.  Please cover windows                      on RVs as not to accidentally have a family member flash the crowd with white light.  The most common                         offending light issues with vehicles are interior dome lights and uncovered backup lights coming on                           unexpectedly.<P>

              Red and green lasers are permitted.  Do not point them horizontally at people or trailers!  Lasers will                       not show on astrophotos unless they are held in the same place for many seconds. Use them sparingly.                          Lasers will be used extensively during the scheduled starwalks from 10:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m Friday and                        Saturday night.<P>

              The SSSP Committee welcomes astronomy (and related) dealers to set up booths at the SSSP.  At this event you have the potential to reach nearly 300 astronomy enthusiasts just looking to buy something.<P>  

To participate, you are asked to follow the standard registration procedure - i.e. vendors must register as normal participants at the normal costs for the star party.  You may in turn sell and conduct normal business within the Meadows campground (but due to Park restrictions cannot solicit elsewhere in the park.)  The SSSP is not responsible for any of the vendor's business costs (transportation, accommodation, living, etc.) Vendors are responsible for their own arrangements, park entry and must pay standard camping fees (to the Park) and camp site power if needed, if staying in the Meadows.  The SSSP is not responsible for any merchandise loss or damage.  As registered SSSP star party goers, all vendors are welcome to participate in all activities they have registered for.<P>

If you would like to donate a door prize, this will be graciously accepted & will be accordingly acknowledged, though a door prize donation is not required and is at the discretion of the vendor.  Vendors will receive a free 1/4-page ad in the star party handout literature or for $25 can purchase a full-page ad.  (Ads in the SSSP handout are gray-scale photocopied and are not in colour).  Alternately, the SSSP will pre-package vendor-supplied product brochures in our registration folders for 25 cents per copy.  Approximately 120 registration packages are handed out.  Vendor must provide the ad or the product brochures at least 2 weeks prior to the star party.  (Mail to or contact the Registrars).<P>

In a further attempt to foster this on-going good will, all star party vendors will be entitled to two separate half-page ads (or equivalent - e.g. four 1/4-page ads) in our monthly newsletter, over the coming year.  These ads are at no additional cost.  Our current newsletter circulation is approximately 80 copies, but these are highly targeted readers & the newsletters are also on-line.  All ads are subject to approval by the Saskatoon Centre Executive before inclusion in the newsletter.  We will do our best to publish the ad in the month desired, but this is also subject to available space within the newsletter.<P>

              The SSSP will offer <B>complete refunds</B> for registration costs and prepaid activities, without a handling fee, to participants who wish to withdraw from the SSSP prior to the start of the star party and for <B><I>no-show</I></B> participants <B>except as follows.</B>  SSSP cannot refund the prepaid banquet costs within 48-hours of the banquet (ie. after 5:00 p.m. on the preceding Thursday) since the SSSP locks in their banquet costs to the Resort at that time.  If shirts are pre-ordered, the SSSP may not be able to cancel shirt orders within 3 weeks of the star party.  If possible, refunds for shirts will be made, but if cancellation is not possible, shirts will be mailed out at the withdrawing participant’s cost after the star party.  No shows are defined as those who have not registered by the end of registration period on the Saturday afternoon of the star party.<P>

<B>However, banquet tickets are always in demand right up to the starting minute of the banquet!</B>  There is almost always a waiting list since banquet seating space is limited.  If you have not made previous arrangements and find that at the last minute you cannot come to the star party or cannot attend the banquet, <B>please telephone us at 306-343-9836 or 306-222-0515</B> (star party cells) <B>and let us know if you will release your banquet tickets for resale.</B>  If we can resell your banquet tickets, we will refund the entire cost to you, even within the 48-hour no-refund window.  Someone at the star party will be delighted that you thought of them!  Otherwise, your tickets will be held for you assuming you will show up at the last minute and are thus not otherwise refundable.<P>

            If you have not been to the Cypress Hills Inter-provincial Park, 
            you are missing something! This is a beautiful park, nested in 
            Lodgepole pines on a butte that reaches 1460 meters above sea level, 
            and is the highest point in Canada between the Rockies and Labrador. 
            (Because of the altitude - bring warm clothes for night time!) Its 
            unique position gives it an unusual weather advantage. Historical 
            weather maps published by Jay Anderson in the RASC Observer's 
            Handbook indicate that the area around Cypress Hills has the best 
            chance for clear skies (less than 30 percent mean nighttime cloud 
            cover) in July and August compared to any other site in Canada.  Also,
            no mosquitos!<P>
            The park is very modern and well equipped for families of tired 
            astronomers. The park features a lake, hiking trails, paddle boats, 
            mini golf, regular golf, a general store, a full resort, two 
            restaurants, an ice-cream and snack shop, a souvenir shop, moose and 
            other varmints (no snakes or big cats), ball diamonds, picnic 
            grounds, tennis courts, an outdoor heated pool, hot tub, a museum 
            and of course, the SSSP! More on the park is found at:
